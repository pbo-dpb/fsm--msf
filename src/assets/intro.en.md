## Overview

The PBO Force Structure Model of Canada’s military consists of an independent estimation of annual personnel, operations, and sustainment (POS) costs of 21 identified military capabilities across all branches of the Canadian Armed Forces (CAF), based on multiple years of accounting data provided by the Department of National Defence.

The purpose of this model is to shed light on the annual costs needed to support the CAF’s various military capabilities and the potential tradeoffs that are implied should a government policy require the adjustment of the structure of the military.

These costs are divided into three categories: _direct_ costs, _indirect_ costs, and _overhead_ costs. This delineation provides a clearer understanding regarding the proportion of expenditure that enables the use, support, and maintenance of a military capability versus that which is a necessary part of the force mix but does not produce an independent military effect itself.

The PBO Force Structure Model also includes estimates of personnel figures associated with each capability, at each of the _direct_, _indirect_, and _overhead_ levels. This allows for the combined analysis of estimated POS costs and personnel levels associated with each capability.

The model also provides users the ability to examine changes in costs and personnel counts as the quantity of a given military capability is adjusted, enabling portfolio-level tradeoff analysis of the full suite of military capabilities.

## Notes

Further information on the methodology used to develop this model is available here (\*\*\*link to report\*\*\*). All figures are represented in 2022-23 Canadian dollars. Estimates reflect a “steady state” cost that assumes the military will continue to operate in a similar manner as it has over the 6 years included in the data (2016-17 through 2021-22). By design, some capabilities cannot be modified in the tool as they cannot feasibly be increased or decreased in the medium term (~5 years).
